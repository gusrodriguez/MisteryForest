# Mistery Forest

## A Game?
Well, it's a very primitive wannabe-game engine that includes render, movement, jump and basic collision detection and resolution.

## What could it be useful for?
The project was developed in hard mode. Pure javascript. No engines involved. The purpose of the project is to understand the very basis of a game architecture based on tiles.

## Install dependencies.
```
npm install
```

## Run te app: 
```
gulp start
```

Make sure to install gulp in global mode :arrow_right: Sorry about this. It will be fixed :pray:
